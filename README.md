A concise record of what I did in this project.

What I did
- Loaded the "Cost_of_Living_Index_2022.csv" dataset into a Jupyter notebook (analysis.ipynb).
- Inspected the data (head, tail, columns, shape, dtypes).
- Cleaned basic issues (missing values, mislabeled types).
- Calculated descriptive statistics for key columns.
- Created visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter/compare plots) to compare indices across countries.
- Produced short summary tables and observations in the notebook.
- Ran the notebook in Google Colab (cells may include Colab helpers).

Files
- analysis.ipynb — the notebook containing the code, plots and notes.
- Cost_of_Living_Index_2022.csv — dataset expected by the notebook (add to repo or upload in Colab).
- README.md — this file.

How to open
- In Google Colab: open analysis.ipynb and upload the CSV or mount Drive.
- Locally: open analysis.ipynb with Jupyter Lab/Notebook (ensure the CSV is accessible).

Requirements (basic)
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- (Optional) Google Colab

Notes
- The notebook is exploratory and contains the code and outputs for the steps listed above.
- If you need the README changed further or shortened, tell me exactly which lines to remove.
